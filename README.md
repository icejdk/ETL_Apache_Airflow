# Project Description

I am a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. I have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. My job is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.


Objectives
In this project i will author an Apache Airflow DAG that will:

Extract data from a csv file
Extract data from a tsv file
Extract data from a fixed width file
Transform the data
Load the transformed data into the staging area
